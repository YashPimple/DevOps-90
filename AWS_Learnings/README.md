Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud we can use it to launch and manage virtual servers, also known as instances, and can choose from a wide variety of instance types that are optimized for different use cases. Here are some important concepts to keep in mind:
- Instance Types: EC2 offers a wide variety of instance types that vary by compute, memory, storage, and network capacity. You can choose the instance type that best meets your application's needs.
- Security Groups: Security groups act as virtual firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic to your instances. You can specify the traffic rules that are allowed or denied based on the source IP, destination IP, and protocol.
- Amazon Machine Images (AMIs): An AMI is a pre-configured virtual machine image that contains the information required to launch an instance. You can use a public AMI or create your own custom AMI.
